Make sure you've read [how to code](/code-with-python/) first. Else this won't make sense.

## Python is for hackers

If you subscribe to the [tutor mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor) the welcome e-mail will send you this article : [How to become a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html).

I don’t need to say anything else here.

## Versions

Python comes in different versions. By default, Python probably means Python 2. You want to learn Python 3. So, make sure you use type Python 3 when Googling and to use `python3` command line and not just `python`.

## Python interpreter

Python 3 has a live interpreter you can code directly into to test your snippets. Give it a try. Type “python3”. If you get an error “apt-get install python3” and try again.

## Use a linter

A linter checks your code for syntax errors and bad writing as you go. It tells you where you mess up. Use Flake8 “apt-get install python-flake8”.

On Atom you’ll also have to install the [linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) and [linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8) plugins.

## Starting with basics

[CodeCademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) is a great site to learn. It’s free and offers different classes in many languages. That’s always where I start when picking up a new language.

## From Pycon 2015
