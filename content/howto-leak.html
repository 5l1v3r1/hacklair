<p>Leaking documents online is controversial and fall into grey areas of the laws. They are an essential parts of revealing the truth and corruption but there&#8217;s various issues. They are dangerous to people manipulating them. They can endanger and harm innocents. They can become noise. It&#8217;s therefor essential to better this practice. A good example of a very useful successful leak is <a href="http://wcitleaks.org/">WCITleaks</a>.</p>
<h2>Do not share unfiltered leaks to the public</h2>
<p>You never know what information are in certain leaks. The implications of releasing uncleaned/sanitized leaks are staggering. What could be a simple PDF can get you into serious trouble if traced back to you, aka the sender. It&#8217;s important to properly clean and protect the data in leaks.</p>
<h2>Remove personal information</h2>
<p>Innocent people could be harmed &#8212; it&#8217;s impossible to be sure what effects the leaks can have. It&#8217;s always better to remove any personal information. We&#8217;ll try to provide tools to make this work simpler. They will range from Windows applications to Linux terminal applications.</p>
<h2>Select important information to release</h2>
<p>Without context it&#8217;s almost impossible to the public, reporters and any inexperienced writer and analyst to understand information from leaks. It&#8217;s also very likely that they will just become noise. That&#8217;s why selecting portions of leaks and explaining them to the public is crucial.</p>
