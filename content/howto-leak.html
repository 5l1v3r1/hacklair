<p>Leaking documents online is controversial and fall into grey areas of the laws. They are an essential parts of revealing the truth and corruption but there’s various issues. They are dangerous to people manipulating them. They can endanger and harm innocents. They can become noise. It’s therefor essential to better this practice. A good example of a very useful successful leak is <a href="http://wcitleaks.org/">WCITleaks</a>.</p>
<h2>Do not share unfiltered leaks to the public</h2>
<p>You never know what information are in certain leaks. The implications of releasing uncleaned/sanitized leaks are staggering. What could be a simple PDF can get you into serious trouble if traced back to you, aka the sender. It’s important to properly clean and protect the data in leaks.</p>
<h2>Remove personal information</h2>
<p>Innocent people could be harmed — it’s impossible to be sure what effects the leaks can have. It’s always better to remove any personal information. We’ll try to provide tools to make this work simpler. They will range from Windows applications to Linux terminal applications.</p>
<h2>Select important information to release</h2>
<p>Without context it’s almost impossible to the public, reporters and any inexperienced writer and analyst to understand information from leaks. It’s also very likely that they will just become noise. That’s why selecting portions of leaks and explaining them to the public is crucial.</p>
