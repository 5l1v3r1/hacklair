This tool was coded by some guy, shared via Twitter and wasn’t saved anywhere on the net. I snatched it a while ago and nobody shared it around so I uploaded it.

It’s a Wordpress plugin that changes the default comment system.
What it does :

* Remove the requirement to provide an e-mail
* Remove the website field
* Change the saved IP in the database to 127.0.0.1
* Change the saved e-mail in the database.
* Name the contributor “Anonymous” if no name provided.
* Prevent spambot (work quite well).

A pretty simple but pretty handful.

Here’s [the code](https://github.com/SageHack/anonspam).
