# The best CloudFlare Resolver

This project was a personal challenge. I wanted to learn Python and get into the security analysis scene a bit and see what I could achieve.

Turns out I created the most advanced and complete CloudFlare resolver tool so far. It can scan lists of sites and thereâ€™s a lot of scanning options.

It even got the attention of a well know CloudFlare security analyst. Check this [twitter convo](https://twitter.com/sagehack/status/594653451046498307).

To learn about or use the tool check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SageHack/cloud-buster).
