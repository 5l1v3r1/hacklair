# Anonymous Wordpress comments

This tool was coded by some guy on twitter and wasn’t saved anywhere on the net. I snatched it a while ago and nobody shared it around so I uploaded it.

It’s a Wordpress plugin that change the default comment system.
What it does :

* Remove requirement to provide an e-mail
* Remove the website field
* Change the saved IP in the database to 127.0.0.1
* Change the saved e-mail in the database.
* Name the contributer “Anonymous” if no name provided.
* Prevent spam bot (work quite well).

Pretty simple but pretty handful.

Here’s [the code](https://github.com/SageHack/anonspam).
