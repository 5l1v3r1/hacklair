# A guide for the modern day freedom fighter

It’s an ambitious project that will teach everybody how to become activists in the modern day and age. It’s going to cover a [long list of topic](https://github.com/SageHack/artofactivism/blob/master/TOC.md).

That’s all fun and good but the most important part is that it’s going to be created using [HuGo](http://gohugo.io) static website generator.

This is important for various reasons :

* No database.
* Use with GIT.
* Require no technical skill to add content.
* Minimal tech requirements to deploy.
* Easy mirroring to multiple servers.

I haven’t started the project yet but the website you’re on at this very moment use the exact same technologies and is aimed at teaching activism to the hacker niche. It’s my proof of concept.

For all the infos, check the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/SageHack/artofactivism/blob/master/TOC.md).
