I wrote this tool during [#OpISIS](https://anoninsiders.cyberguerrilla.org/opisis-a-message-from-anonymous-and-friends-3143/index.html). At that time, quite a few Anonymous activists were complaining that Cloudflare was protecting ISIS websites. I wanted to show them that instead of complaining, they should get hacking. It was also a personal challenge: learn Python, learn more about pen testing, and write a workin pen test tool.

Turns out I created the most comprehensive Cloudflare resolver. It can scan lists of sites and thereâ€™s a lot of scanning options.

It even got the attention of Cloudflare head of security. Check this [twitter convo](https://twitter.com/sagehack/status/594653451046498307).

Almost three years later I found another guy who built another working resolver and [contacted him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/m0rtem/status/974029129115938816). He helped me improve the tool a lot by adding features from [CloudFail](https://github.com/m0rtem/CloudFail) into [CloudBuster](https://github.com/SageHack/cloud-buster).
