This project was a personal challenge. I wanted to learn Python and get into the security analysis scene a bit and see what I could achieve.

Turns out I created the most advanced and complete CloudFlare resolver tool so far. It can scan lists of sites and thereâ€™s a lot of scanning options.

It even got the attention of CloudFlare head of security. Check this [twitter convo](https://twitter.com/sagehack/status/594653451046498307).

Almost three years later I found another guy who built another working resolver and [contacted him on twitter](https://twitter.com/m0rtem/status/974029129115938816). He helped me improve the tool a lot by adding features from [CloudFail](https://github.com/m0rtem/CloudFail) into [CloudBuster](https://github.com/SageHack/cloud-buster).

To download and use the tool check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SageHack/cloud-buster).
