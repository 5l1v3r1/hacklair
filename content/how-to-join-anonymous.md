So you want to get on board the Lulzboat? You better get ready cause it’s no joy ride, sometimes it’s borderline the Raft of the Medusa.

## Alternative movements

You might want to consider joining a publicly and legaly known activist movement where you don’t need to live like Batman. Here’s a small list of [some movement I like and support](https://twitter.com/SageHack/lists/activist-collectives/members).

## Before you begin

There’s a lot to learn before you feel at home within the Anonymous collective. I’d say on average it’s going to take from one to tree years. Depends on how tech savy and brilliant (or fucked up) you are.

## About the Anonymous movement

There’s a lot of stuff you can check out to educate yourself about the Anonymous movement. I recommend you watch and read all of them, in any order.

* [Anonymous on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_group)
* [We Are Legion](http://wearelegionthedocumentary.com/)
* [The Hacker Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku9edEKvGuY)
* [The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpvcc9C8SbM)
* [Red Hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf-24WuN--Y)
* [Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/19/hacker-hoaxer-whistleblower-spy-many-faces-anonymous-gabriella-coleman-review)

## New software

There’s a lot of stuff you need to understand and be able to use. This is the part that take time.

### An introduction

If you’ve never heard for Free and Open Source Software then you need to start reading. Read those two Wikipedia articles: [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).

### Practicing

This is the part that’s going to make you rage or proove you worthy. If you can’t succeed on your own, try again or get the fuck out.

If you use Windows or OSX you need to [learn Linux](/learn-linux/).

## Other software

There’s a lot of software you must learn to work with. If you know what you are doing, use anything you want. If not, start with those. They are the easiest to learn.

### Browsing

Read and follow this guide : [Better Browsing](https://help.riseup.net/en/better-web-browsing)

### Email

This part is hard because of encrypted e-mails. It’s not easy to understand at first.

First, in a terminal type “sudo apt-get install gnupg2”.

Second, install [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) with [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php).

Third, [how to send encrypted e-mails](http://thehackernews.com/2014/01/PGP-encryption-Thunderbird-Enigmail_12.html).

### Instant messenger

[Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) & [OTR](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) ([setup tutorial](https://www.cyberguerrilla.org/blog/?p=17932)).

### Websites

Here’s some useful ressources :

[OneShar.es](https://oneshar.es/), [10MinuteMail](http://10minutemail.com/), [Fake Name Generator](http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/), [RiseUp collaborative Pads](https://pad.riseup.net/), [GhostBin](https://pad.riseup.net/)

### Other important information

Stop using skype : [Here’s why](https://we.riseup.net/riseuphelp+en/skype).

## Anonymity & Privacy

Ok, so now is the hard part. It’s really important that you learn what is and how to use Tor and VPNs properly.

Tor is for Anonymity.  
VPN is for Privacy.  
Confuse them at your own demise.

Start with Wikipedia: [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_anonymity_network) & [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network).

### Tor

Now setup Thunderbird and Pidgin to work with Tor. From now on we will use the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) for browsing. For Thunderbird (install [TorBirdy plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/)) and for Pidgin go to Tools > Preferences > Proxy. Set “Proxy type” to “Tor/Privacy (SOCKS5)”, “Host:” to “127.0.0.1” and “Port” to “9050”. Something the port is “9150”, not sure why.

### VPN

For the VPN you’ll be on your own. Find one that you think might work for you. Don’t use VPNs for Anonymity cause sometime VPNs are compromised. They protect against external spying but they don’t protect your private identity (yeah…)

For VPNs google “torrentfreaks vpn anonymity”.

## Forget your real identify

From now on **never** use anything that could link to you. Consider everything: any accounts or software you paid for or that contain any information about you. Especially **your email addresses**, your name and **any nickname you ever used**. If you don’t do that **you’re fucked**. It really is down and dirty Darwinian.

## Join!

* Connect on one of their IRC servers (you'll have to Google that up).
* Join the channel [#OpNewBlood](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpNewBlood).

## Hacking

Ah yeah… This is the part that you wanted right? If you got everything in this guide so far, then your new quest can begin. We hope you have five to ten years to train, cause yeah, that’s how long it take to become a real hacker.

Read [How to become a Hacker](/become-a-hacker). The whole thing yes!!!
