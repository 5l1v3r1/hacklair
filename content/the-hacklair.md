It’s this website. Yep everything is on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/SageHack/hack-lair).

Why? Because it’s a prototype of decentralised versionable websites.

I wanted to see it was possible to create ultra light weight no database easy to deploy and mirror website for other projects. So I created this website.

That’s just it really...
