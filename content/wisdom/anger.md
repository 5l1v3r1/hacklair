# Anger is a sign of weakness

“If your mind is dominated by anger,  you will lose the greatest part of your human intelligence: wisdom, that is the ability to discern between good and evil. Anger is one of the greatest problems that we have to face in the world today.

In the course of our daily human relations, if we speak straightforwardly and in a reasoned way, anger is not necessary. Any points of difference can be discussed. Whenever we cannot justify ourselves through reason, that is when anger rises. It is when reason ends that anger begins. In my experience, even if anger gives us the strength to react or to respond in the event of conflict, the energy it gives us is blind and difficult to control. The only advantage that anger has is the energy it brings us, but we could find this energy just as well from other sources without having  harm ourselves and others.”

The Dalai Lama’s little book of inner peace p.259
