+++

It’s software that is legally protected in such a way that anybody can use it as they see fit. It also protects the source code from being hidden to the users.

## What is source code?

It’s what humans use to tell machines and software on how to behave when you use them.

## How is that helpful?

### Free and equal access

Almost all free software is free to use and can be legally used by everybody.

### Trusting the software

If the source code is readable, then people can verify that the software does what it says. Let’s say, for example, that [RiseUp.net release a document that explains how Skype is spying on you](https://we.riseup.net/riseuphelp+en/skype). There’s no way to validate since the source cause is unavailable. If Skype was free software, we could verify it.

### Control, or Freedom

Having access to the source code means we can control what the software does. This, in theory, prevents outsiders from inserting malware and surveillance systems in your software.

### Crowdsourced efforts

Free software allows communities to create software for users, which is superior to corporations creating software for profit. The [Linux operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is one of the best examples.

# Why should we care about Free Software?

Without free software, everybody on earth would be at the full mercy of government mass surveillance and corporations control. It is the only technological tool we have against them. Learning, using and sharing free software is contributing to freedom, respect, equality, and transparency for all.
