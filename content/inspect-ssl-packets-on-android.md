It's rather easy to decipher SSL encrypted traffic on any Android device. You install a self sign CA Certificate and bam!

With this attack you can read and tamper data on the fly, as long as you can catch the data flow.

## Security implications

> Adding a new certificate to your list of trusted credentials potentially gives the owner of that certificate the ability to impersonate any secure server such as a secure website or email server, defeating the verification mechanism of SSL. Only install new credentials from sources that you trust.

## How it works

* Add trusted fake SSL certificate to your device
* Encrypt traffic with fake certificate
* Send traffic through your device VPN
* Decrypt with fake certificate
* Capture
* Encrypt with real certificate
* Send to destination

The following article explain how to set things up manually. Everything is explained thoroughly. If you read it carefully, you'll understand the inner workings pretty easily.

## How to prevent the attack

To prevent tempering you can sign the data with a public key and verify the signature on your server with the private key.

I'm still trying to figure out how to prevent decryption
