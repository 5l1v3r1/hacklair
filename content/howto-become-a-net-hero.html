<p>You can become an Internet hero and save the day! It&#8217;s not that hard, but you&#8217;ll have to work for it. If you think somebody else will do it for you, think again. We&#8217;ve seen our shares of online revolution and the formula is pretty easy. You just need to become the spark that light the fire!</p>

<h2>Pick your cause</h2>
<p>Whatever the reason you wanna go in revolution mode, it need to be clear and simple. Write it down and make sure anybody can understand what you want.</p>
<h2>Setup your Internet security</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to prepare your computer according to the dangers you will be facing.</p>
<p>This <a href="/simple-vpn-guide">simple VPN guide</a> will help you get started, but you might not need to go all the way. If your life <strong>will not be in danger</strong>, it&#8217;s probably better that you fight in the open and become an avatar for your activist army. But if you think your life could be in danger, then make sure to use a secure setup.</p>
<p>In most case, using the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock/">uBlock</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href="https://startpage.com/">StartPage</a> should be enough.</p>
<p>You also need to read those documents about <a href="https://help.riseup.net/en/better-web-browsing">secure browsing</a> and <a href="https://we.riseup.net/riseuphelp+en/skype">Skype</a>.</p>
<h2>Document everything</h2>
<p>The key to success is getting information. You need to document everything that is happening. Gather all articles you can find on the net and save all the links on your computer hard drive and <strong>back it up</strong> online, or offline at a friend&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> to store logins, passwords, links, emails and contact info. Make sure you use a pass phrase, not a password.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, if you are using Microsoft Office, uninstall it right now. Use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> instead.</p>
<p>Save photos and videos you can use.</p>
<h2>Regarding photos</h2>
<p>Mobile phones will save GPS location and other information in pictures. Most camera will save some data as well. Make sure you understand how it work. You might need to remove the data from photos or else this could compromise you.</p>

<h2>The art of searching</h2>
<p>Google News and Twitter are very good sources if information. Make sure you use them to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>When reading articles make sure it as sources. Check the bottom for sources and read them also. I&#8217;ve seen articles getting reused over 12 times, each one, changing some info. It can distort the original article quite a lot.</p>
<h2>Start a blog</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to make all the information public. Once your story goes wild you want everything to be ready.</p>
<p>You need a blog. There&#8217;s a bazillion places for that. Just get a free blog somewhere and you should be fine. <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> is easy to use.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few tips</p>
<p><strong>Save your articles offline</strong><br />
Your blog can get hacked, censored or whatever. Save what you write offline! Or you will regret it for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Brand your operation</strong><br />
Choose a unique name that&#8217;s easy to remember. People will Google this. Idle no more, Reset the Net and Occupy Wall Street are great examples. If you wanna save local cats from abuse choose something like &#8220;Save local kitties!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Use your name everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>Have people proof read what you write</strong><br />
If you make mistakes you&#8217;ll look like a retard, and people will discredit you.</p>
<p><strong>Link to relevant document, photos and videos</strong><br />
That&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll make your opinion matters and also prove what&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Open appropriate social media account</strong><br />
Each social network have it&#8217;s pros and cons. They might be useful or not. Make sure you think about which one would benefit you, if they do.</p>
<h2>Once you get the hang of it</h2>
<p>Doing all this will take you quite some time but you&#8217;ll learn a lot along the way. Once you start feeling confident the time has come to act.</p>
<p><strong>Talk to friends</strong><br />
Show your work to plenty of friends. They will criticize and judge you. Stay humble and become your own judge. Some will be right, some will be wrong, some will help you, some will hinder your effort. You&#8217;ll learn who are you true friends and how are not.</p>
<p><strong>Start sharing your info</strong><br />
Start sharing all the documentation and events you&#8217;ve gathered. Most importantly to journalists. Try sharing to small local indy blogs and newspapers. Don&#8217;t got for the big fish first. It won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Contact appropriate activist network. Anonymous is good for Internet related matters but if you&#8217;re trying to save the amazonian forest, you should try Green Peace. There&#8217;s one for every problem out there.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
