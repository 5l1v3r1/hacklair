Two simple [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) scripts to help you delete your Facebook or Twitter timelines.

## It’s probably a soft delete

Facebook and Twitter make money on your data. So you can be sure that they keep everything that you delete.

In short, if you remove a photo, undo a retweet or a like, other people won’t see it but Facebook and Twitter probably keep it in their database.

That’s what we call soft deleting. In opposition to hard deleting.

## Twitter timeline cleaner

The [Twitter tool](https://github.com/SageHack/twitter_timeline_cleaner) undo your retweets, favorites and remove your tweets.

## Facebook timeline cleaner

The [Facebook tool](https://github.com/SageHack/fb_timeline_cleaner) remove your photos, your posts, your comments, unfriend people and undo your likes. Some weird content won’t be removed so you have to clean some stuff yourself.
