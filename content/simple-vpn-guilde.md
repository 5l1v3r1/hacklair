This guide is dedicated to all new online activists who need guidance with VPNs (virtual private networks). Weâ€™re going to help you with your first setup choice.

Never use the suggested setup for anything related to your personal life. No personal facebook, twitter, banking, MSN, Hotmail, Gmail, etc.

## Before we start

You need to understand the following topic so read each page carefully : [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vpn), [Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server), [VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine), [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).
**Never use free services.** There are always hidden unwanted side backs that will put you at risk.
Use bitcoin to buy your service if possible. Itâ€™s an anonymous online payment system.

## Choose your setup

### Dedicated Device + VPN

This is the most effective, easy and secure setup.

* Install a new OS (operating system) on your machine. We recommend [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (beginners) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/).
* Configure your VPN.

This can work with iPods, iPads, computer and any device that supports VPNs.

### Dedicated VM + VPN

Bit more technical but very effective. You need a powerful PC.

* Install your virtual machine software. We recommend [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
* Install your OS. We recommend [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (beginners) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/).
* Configure your VPN.

### Using TOR Browser bundle with a paid proxy

Simple, secure and effective. You canâ€™t do anything outside a browser.

* Install [TOR Browser bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en).
* Choose a proxy. We recommend contacting [WhatTheServer](http://whattheserver.me/) and ask them to set you up with an SSH tunnel.
* Setup your proxy as explained.
* Start the TOR Browser Bundle.
* Click on the onion icon on the left side of the address bar.
* Setup your proxy instead of TOR proxy.
* Never do anything outside of your browser.

### Using TOR Browser bundle on your normal PC

Simple, very secure but very very slow.

* Install [TOR Browser bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) and use it ðŸ˜›
* Read this [TOR Browser encryption guide](https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https) and understand it.
* Never do anything outside of your browser.
