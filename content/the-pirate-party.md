The Pirate Party is a political movement that supports civil rights, direct democracy, reform of copyright and patent law, the free sharing of knowledge, information privacy, transparency, freedom of information, anti-corruption and network neutrality.

Pirate Parties International represents and supports its members around the globe.

Getting involved in a Pirate Party is an excellent way to promote durable and significant legal changes, especially if you agree with the principles guiding the Free Software and Open Source community or the Hacktivist community.

To know more you should watch [Rick Falkvinge TedX talk on “The politics of protest”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsI3-IEWgFg). It’s a great speech on how governments around the world are cracking down on Internet freedom and how we can politicly get involved to change things.
