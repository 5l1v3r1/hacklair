Those are the password lists I use with hashing software like Pyrit and Hashcat. They've been pretty useful so I wanted to share them with the Interwebz.

I know you're all a bunch of white hat hackers and you'll only use them to test your own devices. Ahem.

## 10 million user/pass combo

In February 2015 [Mark Burnett's released a compilation of 1,000,000 username/password](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/fearing-an-fbi-raid-researcher-publishes-10-million-passwordsusernames/). It contains the most common combination from leaks made available by hackers.

It's not a list you can use for hashing but it got what we need.
