Anon Insiders was a website started in 2011 by a team of Anonymous activists. Over the course of 2012 to 2016 they posted the press releases of every single publicly known Anonymous operation. Each PR was verified by the team and in some case information like the official pad, twitter, YouTube channel and sources were added.

Around mid march 2016 the team left a notice on the website "This site will not be updated in the future and is kept as an archive. You can download the source here." The domain name was not renewed as of April 10th 2016.

I saved their public archive for safe keeping as it's a record worth keeping for studies or future history research about the Anonymous collective.

You can visit the [mirror hosted on CyberGuerrilla](https://anoninsiders.cyberguerrilla.org), [download the archive](https://github.com/SageHack/anoninsiders/archive/master.zip) or visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/SageHack/anoninsiders).
