It can be confusing and difficult for writers to understand the Anonymous collective. Writing about it can easily misinform your audience, especially for less experienced writers. We’re going to list known issues and resolution path.

## Everyone can speak in the name of Anonymous

That’s why Anonymous announce their intent before working. Announcing our intent on known Anons information channel (like notorious twitter accounts and websites) will help you validate the responsibility of our actions. This prevents non Anons associate to give us responsibility for action we didn’t take.

## The movement is a big mass of people with small groups in it

The collective is all the people involved in anonymous and all the splinter cells derived from it. The collective is a representation of all the parts as a whole. Splinter cells are small groups with various independent objectives that may or may not work toward the collective ideals, goals, ethics, etc. Individuals can be in any number of splinter cells or none. Learn to understand the context. It’s going to put everything into perspective.

## Identifying who did what is complicated

[Gabriella Coleman](http://twitter.com/biellacoleman) once said the most certain thing about Anonymous is that it’s almost impossible to be certain who is behind specific actions. It’s true. That said, we still have a few tips to allow you to identify what groups might be behind certain actions.

**Check their twitter accounts**
Most of Anonymous splinter cells have twitter accounts. If they post on their twitter they did some action, it’s usually true. They can still claim someone else action their own. [#LulzSec](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LulzSec) use to say “Did we post about it on twitter? No? Then not us.” The same stand for anon splinter cell websites, if they have one.

**Check out Anonymous Press Releases**
When Anonymous plan on doing something they usually tell beforehand. So check out for PR concerning specific hacks and stuff. If you can’t find one then it’s probably not us.

## What if I make Anons unhappy when writing about them?

We need public opinion to become better, to learn from our mistakes, to see the full effect of our actions, etc. We give our lives to the citizens so they are very important to them. Criticize them! If you speak about specific individuals or groups, be relevant and cite sources if possible.
