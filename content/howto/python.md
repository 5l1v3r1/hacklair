# Learning Python

Make sure you've read [how to code](/howto/code/) first. Else this won't make sense.

## Python is for hackers

If you subscribe to the [tutor mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor) the welcome e-mail will send you this article : [How to become a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html).

I really don’t need to say anything else here.

## Versions

Python come in different versions. By default, Python mean Python 2. You want to learn Python 3. So, make sure you use type Python 3 when Googling and to use Python3 command line and not just Python.

## Python interpreter

Python3 have a live interpreter you can code directly into to test your snippets. Give it a try. Type “python3”. If you get an error “apt-get install python3” and try again.

## Use a linter

A linter check your code for syntax errors and bad writing as you go. It tell you where you mess up. Use Flake8 “apt-get install python-flake8”.

On Atom you’ll also have to install the [linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) and [linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8) plugins.

## Starting with basics

[CodeCademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) is a great site to learn. It’s free and offer different classes in many languages. That’s always where I start when picking up a new language.

## From Pycon 2015

Here’s a few vids from [Python 2015 conferences] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxzjK6GuOHVKR_08TT4hJQ) that you should watch at some point :

[Facts and Myths about names and values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)

[Best practices for beautiful intelligible code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)
