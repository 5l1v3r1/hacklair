# Learn how to use Linux

## Before we start

If you know how to use Linux this guide is not for you.

Read about [free software](/notes/freesoftware).

The focus here is privacy, security, freedom and hacking. If that’s what you want to learn about we’re good.

### What if I’m a gamer?

Valve [now hates Windows](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/07/26/windows-8-is-a-catastrophe-according-to-gabe-newell-valve-hedging-with-steam-on-linux/) and [SteamOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteamOS) run with [Debian](http://debian.org) Linux. For everything else use [Play on Linux](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/).

### Learn to read.

Everything in the Linux world is documented in details. Learn to read before trying random stuff or you’ll get hurt.

### Warnings

This is going to be a long journey and you’ll spend more than a few weekends and sleepless nights setting things up. If you have never use Linux before it might take a year before you feel completely at home.

# Before using Linux

You can prepare your transition by using free software like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) [Clementine](https://www.clementine-player.org/) instead of proprietary software.

# Starting easy

## Ubuntu

The easiest way to learn is to install [Ubuntu for desktop](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). LTS stand for Long Term Support. It’s more stable so that’s what you want to startied.

### The terminal

This is where Linux hold all it’s power. Your first step should be to learn how to install/remove software with it. There’s nothing like installing your favorite software without going through a clumsy wizard and tons of legal user agreements.

Always use the terminal when you can.

# Going further

## Debian

When you feel you’re good with Ubuntu you’ll want to consider learning [Debian](http://debian.org). Ubuntu is based on Debian so you won’t get lost. Debian doesn’t come with all the garbage and dubious “free software” most dislikes. It’s packed with only the most well know and reliable free software.

It’s going to require a bit of configuration to get it working to your taste. But that’s what Linux is about, freedom.

### Why learning Debian is so important

It’s used by a lot of activists, hackers and free software devs. It’s super powerful, lightweight, customizable, reliable and totally free, like in freedom, which make it really secure.

A lot of other important Linux distribution use Debian as a base.

# Other distros

Once you’re good at Debian you’ll want to take a look at Tails and Kali Linux. [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) an amnesic system set for anonymity and security. [Kali Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Linux) is the hacker stuff.
